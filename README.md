## 🎓 Student Performance and Difficulties Prediction

This academic project applies **machine learning algorithms** to predict whether a student is likely to **pass or fail their final exam**, based on real-world data. The dataset used is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).

> 📍 **Institution:** INPT Rabat, Morocco
> 👨‍💻 **Contributors:** Mohammed Al Jadd, Hafssa Boujida, Nouhaila El Nabaoui
> 🎓 **Project Advisor:** Prof. Amina Radgui

## 🔍 Project Objective

* Predict the **academic success** or failure of students.
* Identify the **key factors** that influence student performance.
* Evaluate and compare different **classification models**:

  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)

---

## 🚀 Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a **significant impact** on educational systems globally, often leading to lower student performance. This project aims to explore how **machine learning** can provide actionable insights for **early intervention**, helping teachers, schools, and parents to better support students.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Using historical student data, we aim to:

1. **Predict** if a student will pass the final exam.
2. **Compare** the performance of different classifiers.
3. **Extract the most influential factors**—both positive and negative.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

* **Label Encoding:** String features are mapped to numerical values.
* **Feature Scaling:** Performed using normalization and standardization techniques (excluding binary columns).
* **Example:**

  ```python
  df['Mjob'] = df['Mjob'].map({'teacher': 0, 'health': 1, 'services': 2, 'at_home': 3, 'other': 4})
  ```

---

## 📊 Data Visualization

We used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to gain insights:

* 📈 **Histograms** to explore feature distributions.
* 📦 **Boxplots** to examine variable spread across outcomes.
* 🔗 **Correlation matrices** to detect relationships between features and target variable.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### 1. Logistic Regression

A basic linear classifier used as a baseline.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* Tested multiple values of `k` and distance metrics.
* **Pros:** Simple, effective on small datasets.
* **Cons:** Computationally expensive.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Explored three kernels:

* **Linear**: Best performing (Accuracy: 84%, F1: 0.82)
* **Polynomial**: (Accuracy: 78%)
* **RBF (Gaussian)**: (Accuracy: 83%)

**SVM Hyperparameters Tuned:** `C`, `gamma`, `degree`
Used **cross-validation** to avoid overfitting.

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

* ✅ **Confusion Matrix**
* 📊 **F1 Score**
* 📉 **ROC Curve & AUC Score**

**Best Performer:**
✔️ **SVM with Linear Kernel**

* Accuracy: **84.38%**
* ROC AUC: **0.80**

## 🧪 Feature Impact Analysis

### ✔️ Positive Influencers:

* Parents’ education & job
* Guardian (especially non-parent)
* Study time
* Motivation for higher education

### ❌ Negative Influencers:

* High absences
* Frequent failures
* Going out often
* Poor health
* Advanced age (within this dataset)

*⚠️ Note: These results are dataset-specific (395 students from Portuguese schools) and should not be universally generalized.*

## 📝 Final Thoughts

This project demonstrates how **data science and ML** can help identify at-risk students **before exams**—providing a chance for **targeted interventions**. By understanding **what drives performance**, educators and parents can take meaningful steps to **boost student success**.

> 🧠 *“Technology, when used wisely, becomes a powerful tool for social improvement. In education, it can open doors and level playing fields.”*

---

## 📌 Recommendations

* Educational institutions should track student engagement and intervene early.
* Parents should provide emotional and academic support, including a quiet study space.
* Governments can support low-income students by improving internet access and learning resources.
